  I am a Ph.D. candidate in [sociology at CUNY Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/sociology) and a Demography Fellow affiliated with [CUNY Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.cuny.edu/about/centers-and-institutes/demographic-research/).

  My research primarily examines neighborhood inequality and racialized discourse using spatial and computational methods. I am also working on projects that investigate intra-group diversity of Asian Americans and the impact of anti-Asian discourse. My work has been supported by several grants at the Graduate Center, including Stone Center Junior Scholarship and Provost’s Digital Innovation Grant.

  Currently, I am a teaching assistant for the M.S. in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at the Graduate Center. I also serve as student representative of ASA Section on Asia and Asian America for 2025-2026.
