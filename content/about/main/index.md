  I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at CUNY Graduate Center and a fellow affiliated with CUNY Institute for Demographic Research.

  My research primarily examines neighborhood inequality and racialized discourse using spatial and computational methods. I am also working on projects that investigate intra-group diversity of Asian Americans and intergenerational mobility among immigrants. My work has been supported by several grants at the Graduate Center, including Stone Center Junior Scholarship and Provost’s Digital Innovation Grant.

  Currently, I am a teaching assistant for the M.S. in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at the Graduate Center. I also serve as student representative of ASA Section on Asia and Asian America for 2025-2026.
