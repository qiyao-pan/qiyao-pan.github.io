  I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. I am also a Demography Fellow affiliated with the CUNY Institute for Demographic Research.

  My research primarily examines neighborhood inequality and racialized discourse using spatial and computational methods. I am also working on projects that investigate intra-group diversity of Asian Americans and the impact of anti-Asian discourse. My work has been supported by several grants at the Graduate Center, including Stone Center Junior Scholarship, Dr. Louise Lennihan Arts and Sciences Grant, Provost’s Digital Innovation Grant, and Doctoral Student Research Grant.

  Currently, I am  a teaching assistant for the M.S. in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at the Graduate Center. I am also serving as student representative of ASA Section on Asia and Asian America for 2025-2026. Previously, I served as a Graduate Editorial Assistant for City & Community.
  
  In my spare time, I'm a violinist in community orchestras and at occasional chamber music events.
