  I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at CUNY Graduate Center and a Demography Fellow at CUNY Institute for Demographic Research.

  Broadly speaking, my research examines the forms and mechanisms of urban inequality, with a particular focus on the spatial dynamics of neighborhood services and racialized discourse. My dissertation investigates how neighborhood reputations take shape and how they relate to neighborhood change, by tracing the interactions of local amenities, city services, and media narratives through longitudinal, spatial, and computational analysis. I am also engaged in collaborative projects on intra-group diversity of Asian Americans and intergenerational mobility among immigrants. My work has been supported by several internal grants, including Stone Center Junior Scholarship and Provost’s Digital Innovation Grant.

  I am currently a teaching assistant for the M.S. program in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at the Graduate Center, and I serve as student representative for the ASA Section on Asia and Asian America for 2025-2026.
  
  In my spare time, I am a violinist in community orchestras and occasionally in chamber music groups.
