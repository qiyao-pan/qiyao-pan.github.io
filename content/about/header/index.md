  Hi! I am Qiyao Pan.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at CUNY Graduate Center and a Demography Fellow affiliated with the CUNY Institute for Demographic Research.

My research primarily examines neighborhood inequality and racialized discourse using spatial and computational methods. I am also working on projects that investigate intra-group diversity of Asian Americans and the impact of anti-Asian discourse. My work has been supported by several grants at the Graduate Center, including Stone Center Junior Scholarship and Provost’s Digital Innovation Grant.

Off the clock, I'm a violinist and enthusiastic city wanderer.
