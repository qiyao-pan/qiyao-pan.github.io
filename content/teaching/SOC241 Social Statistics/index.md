### Course Description
Statistics are all around you every day—in advertisements, companies try to lure you by claiming the approval of “4 out of 5 experts” or they tout “success rates.” Newspapers report the findings of social scientists on marriage rates or epidemiologists on the likelihood of disease transmission. Economic decisions at the state and federal level are made on the basis of population statistics, political polls give news pundits talking points, and sports newscasters report the free throw percentages and batting averages of star players.

The primary purpose of this course is to increase your data analysis and statistical literacy. We
will focus on choosing when to use a particular statistical technique and how to interpret the results. We will also learn how to compute simple statistics using a calculator. We will practice these skills through weekly assignments and in-class exercises. Such training will not only make you a more informed citizen and a more intelligent consumer of information, but also serve you well in furthering your education in the social sciences or securing employment outside of the academia.

By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1) Apply the logic of social science research methods using quantitative data measurement
and analysis
2) Analyze quantitative data using basic inferential statistical tools and software
3) Explain why and how we use each statistical tool
4) Accurately interpret statistical results
